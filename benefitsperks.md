### Paid Time Off
Creative Chaos offers 2 weeks of paid vacation, 7 sick days to use at your discretion, and the standard national holidays every year. If you need to take a personal day, they first gets deducted from your sick days and then from your paid vacation. Vacations do not carry-forward to the next year. Use them or lose them. We encourage you to plan in advance and not wait till November or December since there is a high probability that you will get tied in some project.

### Short-term Disability
On top of Paid Time Off, Creative Chaos offers a self-funded short-term disability (STD) plan to all its employees. If you fall ill or injure yourself and are unable to work because of it, let us know and you can take 30 days off at 100% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, our STD policy kicks in and you'll continue to earn 50% of your pay until you're better, up to 3 months off. These days are an emergency reserve, in addition to your vacation/sick time described above. If after this period of time, you still cannot work, talk to UA and we can discuss options.

### Education Benefit
We cover 100% educational expenses for all the children of our **custodial staff**. Admin requires proof of tuition and expenses. Books and supplies are all covered. 

### Trainings
During the year, we encourage you to find trainings that will help you professionally. We cover 75% of all training costs. If you need to buy books or access to any online courses, we cover 100% for a maximum limit of 20k per year.

### Office Timings
We care about getting things done. And we trust you with how you organize yourself. As long as your times are in sync with your team and you are putting in around 8 hours everyday - you should be ok. If your work requires you to have a couple of hours of overlap with our remote teams or geographically dispersed clients, you may find yourself coming in a little early; or staying back a little late. You make the call on how you will handle this. We leave it up to you to decide what times work best for you. 

Most teams work: 11:00am to 8:00pm with a 1 hour lunch break between 1pm-3pm. 

BSD works: 9:30am to 6:30am with a 1 hour lunch break between 1pm-3pm.

### Transportation
We provide transportation to all our associates through our office vans. In the event that our vans do not go to your route; we give a standard fuel allowance of Rs.3500/-. If your home is far, we calculate the distance and reimburse you accordingly. **[TODO: Get more specific info]**. Transportation is provided to our interns as well.

### After-office hours transport
If you are working late, or have to come to work on the weekends, our admin team helps you get you a ride home through our office vans or by arranging a paid-for taxi.

### After-office hours meals
In addition to our after-office hours transport; if you are working late, or have to come to work on weekend; we reimburse you for your meals.**[Todo = get the math for this here]**

### Sabbatical
Every five years, associates are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably six months in advance, so we can coordinate with the client and manage the work-load accordingly.

### Parental Leave
When you welcome a new child (birthed or adopted), Creative Chaos encourages you to take up to 12 weeks leave for primary caregivers and up to 4 weeks leave as secondary caregiver at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an additional 4 weeks leave unpaid.

### Profit Sharing
From 2019, Creative Chaos will start offering profit sharing to its employees. The system is based on two questions at the end of every year...
1. Was this year our most profitable year ever?
2. If yes, then how much better did we do than the previous best year? 10% of that profit will be split amongst the employees.

If you've been working here for 2-5 years, you get 1 cut of the profit share, and if you've been working here for 5+ years, you get 2 cuts of the share. So, the more people who work at Creative Chaos for 2+ years, the more pieces of pie there are to distribute.

### Referral Bonus
Our business is built on referrals. Our friends, acquaintances and past clients have been the source of these referrals. We encourage you to actively talk about our work with your friends and network - you never know where we may find a qualified opportunity. If you refer us a qualified opportunity and we close, we will reward you with a bonus equal to 10% of the contract value for the first year of service - capped at a maximum of $30k per referral. As long as this is not a lead already in our database or a current client; you will be paid the bonus 30 days after payment is received for services rendered. C-Executives and Business Development Team members are not eligible for referral bonuses.
