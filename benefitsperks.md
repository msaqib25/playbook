# Benefits & Perks - US

### Health & Dental Insurance
Health insurance is provided in MA via Tufts Health. Dental coverage in MA is provided via Delta Dental.
Health and Dental insurance is provided in CA via Covered California.

The company pays 100% of the premium and the employee pays 0%. Open enrollment is in November every year. Marriages and domestic partnerships are covered equally.

### Vision
Creative Chaos does not offer vision insurance. However, our medical insurance plan gives discounts on eye exams, glasses and contact lenses.

### Paid Time Off
Creative Chaos offers 3 weeks of paid vacation, a few extra personal days to use at your discretion, and the standard national holidays every year. This is a guideline, so if you need a couple extra days, that's not a problem. 

We don’t track your days off; we use the honor system. Just make sure to check with your team before taking any extended absence, so they’re not left in the lurch.

We don't track sick days either. If you're under the weather, take the time you need to feel better. We encourage you to plan in advance and not wait till November or December since there is a high probability that you will get tied in some project.

### Short-term Disability
On top of Paid Time Off, Creative Chaos offers a self-funded short-term disability (STD) plan to all its employees. If you fall ill or injure yourself and are unable to work because of it, let us know and you can take 30 days off at 100% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, our STD policy kicks in and you'll continue to earn 50% of your pay until you're better, up to 3 months off. These days are an emergency reserve, in addition to your vacation/sick time described above. If after this period of time, you still cannot work, talk to UA and we can discuss options.

### Office Timings
We care about getting things done. And we trust you with how you organize yourself. As long as your times are are in sync with your team and are putting in around 8 hours everyday - you should be ok. If your work requires you to have a couple of hours of overlap with our remote teams or geographically dispersed clients, you may find yourself coming in a little early; or staying back a little late. You make the call on how you will handle this. We leave it up to you to decide what times work best for you.  Generally 8:30am - 4:30pm works well all year around in US. 

### Sabbatical
Every five years, associates are eligible to take a one-month-long paid sabbatical. Just give a heads-up preferably six months in advance, so we can coordinate with the client and manage the work-load accordingly.

### Parental Leave
When you welcome a new child (birthed or adopted), Creative Chaos encourages you to take up to 12 weeks leave for primary caregivers and up to 4 weeks leave as secondary caregiver at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take an additional 4 weeks leave unpaid.

### Profit Sharing
From 2019, Creative Chaos will start offering profit sharing to its employees. The system is based on two questions at the end of every year...
1. Was this year our most profitable year ever?
2. If yes, then how much better did we do than the previous best year? 10% of that profit will be split amongst the employees.

If you've been working here for 2-5 years, you get 1 cut of the profit share, and if you've been working here for 5+ years, you get 2 cuts of the share. So, the more people who work at Creative Chaos for 2+ years, the more pieces of pie there are to distribute.

### Referral Bonus
Our business is built on referrals. Our friends, acquaintances and past clients have been the source of these referrals. We encourage you to actively talk about our work with your friends and network - you never know where we may find a qualified opportunity. If you refer us a qualified opportunity and we close, we will reward you with a bonus equal to 10% of the contract value for the first year of service - capped at a maximum of $30k per referral. As long as this is not a lead already in our database or a current client; you will be paid the bonus 30 days after payment is received for services rendered. C-Executives and Business Development Team members are not eligible for referral bonuses.
