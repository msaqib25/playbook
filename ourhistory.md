# Our History
Creative Chaos was founded in the summer of 2000 by Shakir Husain with 3 employees in a small room in his uncle's architecture practice in Karachi, Pakistan. The internet in 2000 was a dark and ugly place - it was all about iframes, <blink> tags, animated gifs and spaghetti perl-cgi. Shakir, 24 at that time, wanted to bring some sanity to this dark, mind-numbing web. Creative Chaos started out building websites for clients who cared about good design and aesthetics. We called it "New Media" back then. Believe it or not - our tag line back then was "Manage Your Digital Risk". There weren't too many companies back then that understood "New Media" or "Digital".  We developed a reputation and a niche clientele. Initially Creative Chaos only focused on websites, but soon found its way into application development as businesses realized that they needed much more then a website, they needed a "web-version" for their desktop apps. 

In the summer of 2004, Shakir was introduced to Umair by a mutual friend who worked at Creative Chaos. Umair had just recently moved from Boston, and was planning to start his own technology business. The purpose of the meeting for Umair was to get insights from Shakir on whether it was a good idea or not to get into this business. This casual conversation over a cup of tea at CC's Hali road office ended with Umair offering to buy into Shakir's business. And shortly after, Shakir and Umair became equal partners of Creative Chaos. It was an unusually quick transaction. From, first meeting to Umair becoming a partner - it took less than 2 weeks. The speed at which this transaction was completed set the tone for how the two would make decisions for the Company in the future. There's no analysis-paralysis at Creative Chaos.

The two divided and conquered. Shakir took over all things sales and business. Umair took over strategy and execution. Together they expanded the business into web, software, digital and innovation delivery. The company grew from 20 people to 300 over the next decade. 

Creative Chaos was incorporated in the US in 2007 and maintained an office in NewYork, since most of our clients were there.

In 2014 Shakir relocated to San Francisco with his family - the HQ was subsequently moved to SanFrancisco.

In 2016 Umair relocated to Boston with his family, and is in the process of building the North American team.

Over the last decade, Creative Chaos has been involved in many experiments and ventures. The way Umair calls it - "its our playground and we come to work to have fun". Fun means building things; fun means to fix things; fun means to try new ways to do things better; fun means angel investing in startups; partnering with ecommerce companies; starting a SKU product build unit; fun means to spin up a digital agency, create IP in location services, payments, telecom, fun means creating fintech and mass-transit solutions, and dabbling in b2b global technology supplier business. Fun is all about being curious and taking risks. 

Fun for us these days is helping startups and large enterprises bring their ideas to life. 18 years - is a long time. 

We survived, persisted and continue to grow because we are surrounded by associates who we can trust.... associates who were willing to go out of their way to grow the company.... associates who push themselves for excellence...associates who are selfless. We want to acknowledge two of them, without their commitment and contribution - we would not be here.

- Farhan Shaikh (employee # 2 - joined in 2000, still at CC) - responsible for design and aesthetics. He was the 'Creative' in Creative Chaos when we started and still continues to inspire us with his dedication and passion. 

- Imran S. Khan (early employee - joined in 2001, recently resigned because he is moving to Canada - but still an Advisor) - Joined us as an associate web designer and ended up leading the technology teams as Director of Technology and later CEO of Software Services. Imran has been our go to guy for all things technology and delivery and championed a lot of key successful engagements.
