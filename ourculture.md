# Our Culture

"What is the culture here?"

It is probably one the most important question that everyone has when talking about a company. Every associate has some point in time asked or been asked to answer this question. And since everyone has their own definition of culture, their responses are varied. This lack of clarity creates misalignment between company and associates. When this happens, it creates expectations that can never be met and can create anxiety and frustration. The feelings become their answer to the question - "What is the culture here?".

**The culture of the company is set by the company. It is not what a person feels, or thinks or believes in.**

- Culture is NOT having a nice office.
- Culture is NOT the [benefits & perks](benefitsperks.md) or [our exciting rituals](ourrituals.md). 
- Culture is NOT about [transparency in communication](slack.md) or permitting you to [moonlight](moonlighting.md). 

These are all benefits, perks and priviledges.

**Culture is [what we believe](ourcorevalues.md) in and how we fight and protect our core values**

## We Seek Excellence
We are determined to creating a high-performance company.
Our culture is focused on helping us achieve excellence. 

1) Our culture is determined by three simple decisions that the company makes every day:
- Who we hire?
- Who we promote?
- Who we let go?

To answer these questions we focus on the **behavior and skills** that [we value in our associates](whatwevalueinassociates.md).

- **Every associate should question actions that are inconsistent with our values** - this is part of the [Courage Value](whatwevalueinassociates.md#courage)

- These values are reinforced in hiring, performance reviews, comp reviews, promotions and exits

2) High Performance
