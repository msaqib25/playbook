# Our Culture

## "What is the culture here?"

It is probably one the most important question that everyone has when talking about a company. Every associate has some point in time asked or been asked to answer this question. And since everyone has their own definition of culture, their responses are varied. This lack of clarity creates misalignment between company and associates. When this happens, it creates expectations that can never be met and can create anxiety and frustration. The feelings become their answer to the question - "What is the culture here?".

**The culture of the company is set by the company. It is not what a person feels, or thinks or believes in.**

- Culture is NOT having a nice office.
- Culture is NOT the [benefits & perks](benefitsperks.md) or [our exciting rituals](ourrituals.md). 
- Culture is NOT about [transparency in communication](slack.md) or permitting you to [moonlight](moonlighting.md). 

These are all benefits, perks and priviledges.

**Culture is [what we believe](ourcorevalues.md) in and how we fight and protect our core values**

## 1) We Seek Excellence
Our culture is focused on helping us achieve excellence.

Our culture is determined by three simple decisions that the company makes every day:
- Who we hire?
- Who we promote?
- Who we let go?

To answer these questions we focus on the **behavior and skills** that [we value in our associates](whatwevalueinassociates.md).

- **Every associate should question actions that are inconsistent with our values** - this is part of the [Courage Value](whatwevalueinassociates.md#courage)

- These values are reinforced in hiring, performance reviews, comp reviews, promotions and exits


## 2) High Performance
We are determined to creating a high-performance company.

### The objective of any business is to WIN.

- When you **win** good things happen: Promotions, bonuses, betters perks
- When you **lose** bad things happen: Cost-cutting, lay-offs, bankruptcy

To Win - you have to operate like a pro-sports team.
Just like you select the 11 best players for the national cricket team so they can win; we want to do the same for Creative Chaos.

What happens when a player is not performing well in the cricket team; and he is not being dropped after a lot of chances?
- The team suffers, confidence in the team goes down and we all talk about nepotism and politics. 

Every person in a pro-sports team must make an impact. That is the only way to win.
You cannot win matches by having good people. Good people are not necessarily high performers.

**Creative Chaos leaders hire, develop and cut smartly to make sure we have the best players in our team at all times.**

**If we don't, we will LOSE in business**

### Why do we care so much about high-performance?**
- In procedural work, the best are 2x better than the average.
- In creative/inventive work, the best are 10x better than the average, so there's a huge premium on creating effective teams of the best.
