# Our Culture

## "What is the culture here like?"

It is probably one the most asked question when talking about a company from the perspective of an interested candidate. Every associate has some point in time asked or been asked to answer this question. And since everyone has their own definition of culture, the responses vary depending on their experience. This lack of definition in culture results in misalignment between the company and its associates. The lack of clarity of what the culture really is creates expectations that can never be met and results in anxiety and frustration. In the end, the feeling that an associate has for the company becomes their answer to the question - "What is the culture here like?".

**The culture of a company is not a person's feeling.**

- Culture is NOT having a nice office.
- Culture is NOT the [benefits & perks](benefitsperks.md) or [our exciting rituals](ourrituals.md). 
- Culture is NOT about [transparency in communication](slack.md) or permitting you to [moonlight](moonlighting.md). 

These are all benefits, perks and priviledges.

**Culture is how a firm operates; [what it believes in](ourcompanyvalues.md) and how it fights and protects these core values**

These are the core aspects of our culture:
- Values are what we Value
- High Performance
- Context, Not Control

## 1) Values are what we Value

### We seek excellence from our associates

Our culture is determined by how we answer three simple questions every day:
- Who we hire?
- Who we promote?
- Who we let go?

To answer these questions we focus on the **behavior and skills** that [we value in our associates](whatwevalueinassociates.md).

- We want to work with associates that embody these values.

- **Every associate should question actions that are inconsistent with our values** - this is part of our [courage value](whatwevalueinassociates.md#courage)

- These values are reinforced in hiring, performance reviews, comp reviews, promotions and seperations.


## 2) High Performance
We strive to be a high-performance company.

### The objective of any business is to WIN.

- When you **win** good things happen: Promotions, bonuses, betters perks
- When you **lose** bad things happen: Cost-cutting, lay-offs, bankruptcy

To Win - you have to operate like a pro-sports team.
Just like you select the 11 best players for the national cricket team so they can win; we want to do the same for Creative Chaos.

#### What happens when a player is not performing well in the cricket team; and they are not being dropped after a lot of chances?
- The team suffers, confidence in the team goes down.
- We talk about nepotism and politics. 
- We curse the selectors (managers). 

**Every person in a pro-sports team must make an impact. That is the only way to win.**
- You cannot win matches by having average or good players.
- Good players are not necessarily high performers.

### What does this mean?
- Creative Chaos leaders must **hire, develop and cut smartly** to make sure we have the best players in our team at all times.
- If we don't, we will **LOSE** (a client, a unit or our business)

### Why do we care so much about high-performance?
- In procedural work, the best are 2x better than the average.

- In creative/inventive work, the best are 10x better than the average, so there's a huge premium on creating effective teams of the best.

### What about hard workers?
- We care about impact and effectiveness - not necessarily hard work.

- We understand that effectiveness is difficult to measure than effort.

- We measure you by the quality, speed and perfection in your work specially under tight deadlines.

- We measure you by your committments and how you live up to them. This means that you don't care about how many hours you put in, or how many nights or weekends you spend in the office.

- Sustained B-level performers with hard work will always be challenged by A-level performers despite minimnal effort at Creative Chaos. A level performers are more likely to be rewarded with more responsibility, promotion and pay.

### Isn't loyalty good?
We value loyalty as it is a good stabilizer.

- Associates who have been stars with us, and hit a bad patch, get a few quarters to rebound because we think they will become stars again.

- We expect the same: if Creative Chaos hits a temporary bad patch, we want associates to stick with us.

- We value loyalty with effectiveness. An ineffective associate cannot expect unlimited loyalty from us.

### What about brilliant jerks?
You can't be a jerk at Creative Chaos. Even if you are a superstar!

- This attitude may work well at some other companies; but we simply don't tolerate it. 

- For us, the cost of teamwork is too high.

- We are fine with diverse styles and personalities as long as they embody the [values we care about](whatwevalueinassociates.md).


### Our high performance culture is NOT for everyone
Many associates love our culture, and stay here for a long time

- They thrive in an environment that pushes them to become better professionally
- They care about excellence
- They appreciate the openness and candor
- They push themselves to continuously evolve
- They enjoy maintaining a status of a high-performer


## 3) Context, Not Control

We want to work with responsible people and empower them with context and responsibility. 

**Responsible People Thrive on Freedom, and are Worthy of Freedom**

### The Rare Responsible Person
- Self motivating
- Self aware
- Self disciplined
- Self improving
- Acts like a leader
- Doesn’t wait to be told what to do
- Never feels “that’s not my job”
- Picks up the trash lying on the floor
- Behaves like an owner

The best managers figure out how to get great outcomes from responsible people by setting the appropriate context, rather than by trying to control them.

They provide strategy and direction; rather than dictation.

### Context (we should embrace)
- Strategy
- Assumptions
- Objectives
- Clearly-defined roles
- Knowledge of the stakes
- Transparency around decision-making

### Control (we should avoid)
- Top-down decision-making
- Management approval
- Committees
- Planning and process valued more than results

### Exceptions
- Control can be important in emergency, or high-stakes situations
Risk is too high; and there's no time to deliberate

- Control can be important when someone is still learning their area
It takes time to pick up the necessary context

- Control can be important when you have the wrong person in a role
For the short term, there's nothing that can be done but to dictate

### Note to Managers
**Managers: When you are tempted to “control” your people, ask yourself what context you could set instead**

_Are you articulate and inspiring enough about goals and strategies?_

**Managers: When one of your talented people does something dumb, don’t blame them. **

_Instead, ask yourself what context you failed to set._

### Why Managing Through Context?
- High performance people do better work if they understand the context
- They are not just satisifed with meeting expectations - they want to exceed them. 

Providing context, allows them to think beyond what is being asked for.
