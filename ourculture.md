# Our Culture

## "What is the culture here?"

It is probably one the most important question that everyone has when talking about a company. Every associate has some point in time asked or been asked to answer this question. And since everyone has their own definition of culture, their responses are varied. This lack of clarity creates misalignment between company and associates. When this happens, it creates expectations that can never be met and can create anxiety and frustration. The feelings become their answer to the question - "What is the culture here?".

**The culture of the company is set by the company. It is not what a person feels, or thinks or believes in.**

- Culture is NOT having a nice office.
- Culture is NOT the [benefits & perks](benefitsperks.md) or [our exciting rituals](ourrituals.md). 
- Culture is NOT about [transparency in communication](slack.md) or permitting you to [moonlight](moonlighting.md). 

These are all benefits, perks and priviledges.

**Culture is [what we believe](ourcorevalues.md) in and how we fight and protect our core values**

## 1) We Seek Excellence
Our culture is focused on helping us achieve excellence.

Our culture is determined by three simple decisions that the company makes every day:
- Who we hire?
- Who we promote?
- Who we let go?

To answer these questions we focus on the **behavior and skills** that [we value in our associates](whatwevalueinassociates.md).

- **Every associate should question actions that are inconsistent with our values** - this is a part of our [Courage Value](whatwevalueinassociates.md#courage)

- These values are reinforced in hiring, performance reviews, comp reviews, promotions and exits


## 2) High Performance
We are determined to creating a high-performance company.

### The objective of any business is to WIN.

- When you **win** good things happen: Promotions, bonuses, betters perks
- When you **lose** bad things happen: Cost-cutting, lay-offs, bankruptcy

To Win - you have to operate like a pro-sports team.
Just like you select the 11 best players for the national cricket team so they can win; we want to do the same for Creative Chaos.

#### What happens when a player is not performing well in the cricket team; and they are not being dropped after a lot of chances?
- The team suffers, confidence in the team goes down.
- We talk about nepotism and politics. 
- We curse the selectors (managers). 

**Every person in a pro-sports team must make an impact. That is the only way to win.**

You cannot win matches by having average or good players.
Good players are not necessarily high performers.

### What does this mean?
Creative Chaos leaders must **hire, develop and cut smartly** to make sure we have the best players in our team at all times.
If we don't, we will **LOSE** (a client, a unit or our business)

### Why do we care so much about high-performance?
- In procedural work, the best are 2x better than the average.
- In creative/inventive work, the best are 10x better than the average, so there's a huge premium on creating effective teams of the best.

### What about hard workers?
- We care about impact and effectiveness - not necessarily hard work.

- We understand that effectiveness is difficult to measure than effort.

- We measure you by the quality, speed and perfection in your work specially under tight deadlines.

- We measure you by your committments and how you live up to them. This means that you don't care about how many hours you put in, or how many nights or weekends you spend in the office.

- Sustained B-level performers with hard work will always be challenged by A-level performers despite minimnal effort at Creative Chaos. A level performers are more likely to be rewarded with more responsibility, promotion and pay.

### Isn't loyalty good?
We value loyalty as it is a good stabilizer.

- Associates who have been stars with us, and hit a bad patch, get a few of quarters to rebound because we think they will become stars again.

- We expect the same: if Creative Chaos hits a temporary bad patch, we want associates to stick with us.

- We value loyalty with effectiveness. An ineffective associate cannot expect unlimited loyalty from us.

### What about brilliant jerks?
You can't be a jerk at Creative Chaos. Even if you are a superstar!

- This attitude may work well at some other companies; but we simply don't tolerate them. 

- For us, the cost of teamwork is too high.

- We are fine with diverse styles and personalities as long as they embody the [values we care about](whatwevalueinassociates.md).


### Our high performance culture is NOT for everyone
Many associates love our culture, and stay here for a long time

- They thrive in an environment that pushes them to become better professionally
- They care about excellence
- They appreciate the openness and candor
- They push themselves to continuously evolve. They enjoy maintaining a status of a high-performer
