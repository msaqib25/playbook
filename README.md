# This Is Our Playbook
The purpose of this playbook is to bring **clarity** and **alignment** to everyone at Creative Chaos on how we run our company, how we service our customers and how we maintain a high performance culture.

You should never have to guess what we do, what we expect from you, or how to do certain things.


## Core
This is where everything begins. Our reason for existance, what we do, what we stand for and our values. Make sure you understand them well. You cannot be successful at Creative Chaos without truly aligning yourself with our values.
