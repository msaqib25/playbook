# Getting Started

Here are the things that you most care about on Day 1.

## Access Card
In your welcome packet, you should receive a temporary access card. This allows you to get in and out of the office. Do not share your access card with anyone. If you lose it, you can get a replacement for Rs. XX. Our Network team is responsible for getting these cards for you. Ping them on Slack in a few days on when you will receive yours.

## Desk Space
Our Network & Systems team is responsible for allocating a desk space for you. The assignment is made based on a discussion with your supervisor. 

## Laptop / Workstation
The Network & Systems team would have already setup a laptop or desktop for you based on what you do. 
- All developers generally have workstation PCs with Ubunto. 
- Designers use PCs with Windows. Designers are being slowly upgraded to Macs and some already have one.
- Everyone else is generally assigned a PC laptop with windows.

We try to give you the best PC we have in stock. However, if you ever feel that you need an upgrade, discuss the need with your supervisor and if he agrees, create a ticket and we will do our best to facilitate the request.


## Email
In your welcome packet, you should have received a printout with your email id and a temporary password.

**Please login and change your password immediately.

All other information that you need will be available in your email including a link to this playbook.

## Slack
You should have received a Slack invite on your email ID. Sign into slack.

We extensively use Slack for all our communications. Go over our [chapter on Slack](slack.md) and add channels that are relevant to you.

## HelpDesk
We have a helpdesk ticketing system to address any problems or issues you have that are related to our BSD teams. Whether it be related to your admin, network or systems, hr or finance, login to the helpdesk and file a ticket. This is the best way to get the problem resolved.

## Questions
If you have any questions or need clarification for anything from our BSD teams, the best way to get a response is by sending a Slack message on the appropriate help channel - #help-admin #help-hr #help-accounts #help-network #help-slack

## Environment Setup
You will need to setup your environment based on the project / unit that you are a part of. Check out the playbook chapter on environment setup for your unit for details on what you need to do.

## Probationary Assessment
We want to make sure you start becoming a productive member of the team as quickly as possible.
We take the first 3 days, the first 15 days and the first 45 days very seriously.

## Attendance
We track when you come in and when you leave using our biometric attendance machine. You need to get your thumbprints registered. HR should be able to help organize this for you. Ping them on the #help-hr channel if this has not yet been taken care of. Read our Office Timings and Attendance chapter so you understand our policy.

What you should know: In order to process payroll, our Accounts team verifies whether you have been putting in 8 hours a day. Your salary can get delayed or pro-rated incase you do not meet this threshold.

## TimeTracking
If you are a part of AppStudio, Dedicated DevOps or Digital Ops, we track time spent on each project. Our clients require this information and our ability to get paid by our clients is dependent on how accurately you record time spent. Timetracking is done using  CCTracker. Ping network on #help-network if you don't have access to the tracker. Read up on how to use CCTracker here.

What you should know: In order to invoice our clients and get paid on time (which is very important), our Accounts team pulls all the timesheets at the end of every month. We need to be able to prove time-spent - which means you need to keep CCTracker up to date with your work. Our ability to get paid is dependent on this.
