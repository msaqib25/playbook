# Getting Started - Boston

Here are the things that you most care about on Day 1.

## Access Card
When you arrive to the lobby, check-in with a CIC representative and let them know you are joining today. They will take a picture and process a access card. This will let you in the building and our offices.

## Desk Space
You will be assigned a desk space. We are all on the 5th floor at this point in time in one room. 

## Laptop / Workstation
You assigned laptop / desktop / monitor should be on our desk. 
We try to give you the best PC we have in stock. However, if you ever feel that you need an upgrade, discuss the need with your supervisor and if he agrees, we will do our best to facilitate the request.


## Email
You should have received a welcome email to join our company Email on your personal account. If you have not, or the link does not work, contact UA.

**Please login and change your password immediately.

All other information that you need will be available in your email including a link to this handbook.

## Slack
You should have received a Slack invite on your email ID. Sign into slack.

We extensively use Slack for all our project and team communications. [Read more] on how we use Slack(slack.md)

## Wifi Network at CIC?
You can use either the "CIC" or "CIC-A" networks—no password required.
To ensure your communication is secure and private, use only encrypted "https" websites (most are).
You are also welcome to use the "CIC-Encrypted" WPA2 network—password "fix the world through innovation" (with spaces)—but please be aware that this does not provide added privacy versus a skilled hacker.
We disable peer- to -peer trafficking* on all of our networks so that devices cannot see each other, and programs like FireSheep cannot intercept your data.
*This is different from Skype and other VoIP services, which work fine on our network.

## Printing & Scanning at CIC 
Go to the printing.cic.us and follow instructions.

## Receiving Mail and Letters
The mail room is located on the 14th floor near the Charles conference room. Creative Chaos has a mail folder, where we will place your incoming letter mail each day. Mail arrives around noon and is usually sorted by 4pm. We have an outgoing letter drop box inside the mail room so you can send letters without going to the post office!
