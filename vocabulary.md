# Vocabulary
This is a glossary of words that you may often hear at Creative Chaos.

#### Profile X: 
You may overhear someone say 'This is a profile 1 customer'. What they are referring to is the type of customer. Knowing this is important as it allows us to align our approach and strategy.

- Profile 1: Seed Funded Startup. They probably need a MVP
- Profile 2: VC Funded Startups. They probably want to augment their development capabilities and want a dedicated team.
- Profile 3: Mid-Market / Enterprise Clients. The work varies but is generally around reimagining experiences or build a platform or an app.


#### Project:
There are essentially two kinds of engagements that we are involved in.

1. Projects that have a fixed defined scope and timeline are generally handled by Appstudio and Digital Ops and are called "Appstudio Projects" or "Digital Ops Projects". An associate can be involved in multiple Appstudio or DOPs projects.

2. Projects that are retainer based with associates dedicated for 6+ months and generally have no scope or time defined are called "Dedicated Projects." Since these engagements can go on for years; we also refer to them as a "Dedicated Teams". However, technically they are all 'Dedicated Projects with a very long life'.


#### Business Support Department (BSD):
Any department that is not involved in providing core services to our clients is known as a business support department. Without them we would not be able to service our clients and run our operations. Accounts, Admin, HR, Network are as BSDs.


#### AppStudio:
