# Slack

Slack is the central nervous system of our company.

From announcements to key company decisions, internal project collaboration and client communication; we use slack to integrate and make us act like ONE TEAM.

At Creative Chaos, we do not believe in walls and silos. We are open and transparent.

Everyone in the company is aware of whats going on.
Every project, team and dept. has a public channel. This allows everyone to peek in and see whats going on.

A person working in AppStudio is able to peek and see what a Dedicated team is working on. Its like walking into a room and listening in to the conversation.

This level of transparency makes us aware and tightly integrated.

## Members
Slack is used by ALL associates of Creative Chaos across multiple locations.

**Members**
1. All associates in Pakistan are added as FULL MEMBERS.
This adds them to some default channels like #announcements #ideas #kuddos #ama-ua etc

2. All associates in the US and other places are always be added as MULTI-CHANNEL guests.
They are added to location specific channels like #loc-usa, community channels like #comm-designers, #comm-developers, #comm-leads, and to project and client channels they are a part of.

3. All clients will ALWAYS be added as SINGLE-CHANNEL guests:
They are ONLY added to the #client-{projectname} that they are supposed to be on.

Members are invited by Slack admins. If you need to a client or an associate invited to slack, reach the admins by sending a slack to @admins from the relevant group.

## Channels

### Active Projects Channels
For each active project, we start a channel with #proj- (like #proj-spark, #proj-unation, #proj-afs)

- Project channels are only **internal use** channels. **We will never have any clients on them.**
- If you start the project channel; invite the appropriate team members to it.
- Avoid the temptation to join project channels that you are not a part of.
- If your team has been using a private channel for their project, consider archiving it and moving the discussions and conversations to the new #proj- channel.
- Archive the #proj- channel once the project is over and help us with house-keeping.

### Active Projects with Clients Channels
For each active project where the client wants to collaborate with us, we start a channel with #client- (#client-spark, #client-unation)

- Be aware that **any channel that starts with #client- has a client on it.** 
- **Your tone, responses and style of communication should be professional.**
- To invite a client, once you have created the channel, send a msg to @admins from the channel with a Name and Email address of the client you want added to this channel.
- @admins will send an invite to the email address a create the client as a Single Channel Member - meaning they cannot be see or be added to any other channels.
- @admins will only add a client to the channel the request came from.
- When a project is finished, archive both the #proj- and the #client- channel. Before archiving the #client- channel request @admins to deactivate the client account


### Team Channels
For each team, we start a channel #team- (like #team-pmo, #team-architects)

### Help Channels
We let coworkers ask questions and make requests in #help- (like #help-finance, #help-admin, #help-network)

### Fun Channels
We have topic channels for everything else #fun- (like #fun-cricket, #fun-clubchaos)

### Location Specific Channels
We have location specific channels in #loc- (like #loc-pak, #loc-usa, #loc-khi, #loc-khimain, #loc-khibasement, #loc-khimarine4, #loc-lhe)



## Getting Started with Slack
To get started on the right foot - lets get the basics out of the way*

### 1) Update your profile
Click your name and edit profile.

**Full Name:** This should be your full name... relatively easy

**Display Name:** This should be what people call you in everyday conversations. Most of the times it is your first name. If people call you with your first name, use your first name. In case your first name is unavailable, use your email alias.

**What I do:** [Title] - [Project (optional)] - [Department]

Software Developer - AppStudio

QA Engineer - Podium - Dedicated DevOps

Designer - Digital Ops

Admin Officer - Administration

### 2) Update your email address
Some of you name have new email creativechaos.co email addresses. [Here's](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/207262907-Change-your-email-address) what you need to do to fix it.

### 3) Join a community channel
Our communities are based on shared discipline & interest. The four big ones are design, development, qa and leads
These communities live on Slack under our #comm-designers, #comm-developers, #comm-qa, #comm-leads channels
Community members ask questions; share ideas, articles and help each other become better.

### 4) Join your project channels
For each active project, our leads start a public channel with #proj- (like #proj-spark, #proj-litterati , #proj-unation. #proj-boloro). Join the project channel that you are assigned to.

### 5) Join client channel for your project* 
For each active project where the client wants to collaborate with us, our leads start a public channel with #client- (like #client-mpa , #client-unation, #client-boloro). Join the appropriate channel for the project where the client is collaborating.


## Living with Slack
As you start moving towards integrating slack into your DNA; here are some notes that will help you keep your sanity and avoid Slack from going out of control for everyone.

1) Make sure you’re reading the right channels; adjust your notification settings so you’re aware of key updates but not constantly distracted

2) Don’t use @channel unless you really need to notify everyone in the conversation. 

3) Use your real name, title, and photo; 

4) Don’t distract people by idly chatting in channels with many members.

5) Presume people won’t see the message unless you @ them. Simply being in a public channel shouldn’t mean that you need to scroll through every unread message to check you haven’t missed something: if you haven’t received a mention notification, you can presume it wasn’t for you.

6) When writing in a public channel, the responsibility should always lie with the sender to make sure the message is received, so there’s no need for team members to scroll through irrelevant messages, just in case something was meant for them.

7) If you don’t need to see every conversation in a public channel, mute it.

8) Cut down on what’s shown in your Slack sidebar by editing your settings to only show starred channels, those that have pending mentions and direct messages.
