# Our Rituals

## New Associates Orientation
### Signature Hunt
All associates get a signature hunt sheet in their welcome packet. Your task is to go upto 10 people in the company and get their signatures. The sheet has to be returned to HR by the end of your first day. Its a fun activity and we hope you enjoy hunting random associates.

### Lunch with a buddy
You are not eating along on your first day! HR will assign a buddy (someone who is not in your team) who will explain to you the different lunch options, help you order the first lunch (which your buddy will pay for...its your first day so relax) and have lunch and answer any questions you may have. Bonus: You may get introduced to some of their friends. The buddy ends up being a goto person for all kinds of things.

### 15 min meeting with UA
All associates must schedule a [15 minute meeting with UA](https://calendly.com/uaziz/quickchat) within the first week of joining. Its an opportunity to meet UA, tell him about yourself and ask him any questions. Its not an interview...so relax! You are already in.

## Daily

### Standups (Internal)
Every morning our supervisors/team-leads/project managers have a 15 minute standup with the team. Each team member informs everyone what they finished yesterday, what they will work on today, and if they have any impediments.

Teams leads or the entire team may also daily calls with the client to discuss progress.

### CCTracker
At the end of every day, associates in AppStudio, Dedicated & DigitalOps update CCTracker with time spent on each task / activity for each project.

### #kuddos
If anyone helps you out with a problem you are stuck with; if anyone does something where they deserve a pat on the back; if anyone inspires or motivates you; give them a shout-out on our #kuddos slack channel.

## Weekly

### Weekly Status (External)
Teams leads / Teams have a weekly call with the client to discuss progress.
Team leads also send a weekly status update to the Client and copy PMO on it.

### Weekly Status Update
Every week, all our team leaders submit a status update of their project or team on our CC-SVOT (Single version of truth) trello board. The leads highlight key accommplishments, impediments and color code the status of their project as Green (Everything is under control), Yellow (We are cautious) or Red (Danger - we have problems). The SVOT is available for all to review.

## Monthly

### Lunch & Learn
Every Thursday afternoon is lunch & learn from 1-2pm.

Lunch & Learn is an opportunity for us to learn something new every week. Each week the session is from a different category. So you maybe learning something about finance one week, and something about project management or design another. We want to keep it exciting and diversified.

Everyone in the company is encouraged to create a topic (any topic) and put their name on the [shared google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F25ogetFbGa592Q4Zr0LhyMD3aOa26fUl32-9yy8eFc/edit?usp=sharing)

Notes:
- Lunch & learn is generally organized in the main office conference room.
- Since space is limited, only 15 people can attend lunch & learn in person. An email goes out the week of Lunch and Learn for signups.
- We order Pizza for the people in the conference room.
- Everyone else can join the session via Zoom.
- The session is also played in the cafeteria and main development areas so others who cannot be in there in person can hear in.
- The session is recorded and archived.

### Demo Day
Every last Fri of the month, we have Demo day. This is where a team has to demo their product.

We want to present the client, the problem / business case, the technology, the challenges and how we overcame them. 

A calender is maintained in a google doc for Demo Day.

Team leads are expected to review open slots and [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1F25ogetFbGa592Q4Zr0LhyMD3aOa26fUl32-9yy8eFc/edit?usp=sharing) in advance.

Each member of the team is expected to be involved in preparing and presenting. We want everyone to cover an area in the presentation. The lead should use this as an opportunity to get other members in their team to take ownership and keep their own time on the floor limited. 

The presentation is recorded on Zoom and archived.

### Newsletter
Every month we publish an internal newsletter that rounds up news, announcements and other pertinent information that's important for all our associates to know. The newsletter is published in the 1st week of every month.

### Social Lunches
On the 3rd Friday of every month, 6 associates are randomly selected to go on lunch - paid for by the company. Yes - we want you to have fun and meet associates from across the company who you may have never interacted with.

Enjoy yourselves. Please don't talk about work. Take pictures and have fun.

### #ideas
We have an #ideas channel on Slack. This is our online "Suggestion Box". All kinds of tips, ideas are welcome here. One idea is picked every month for possible implementation. If your idea is picked, you get rewarded to a dinner at your favorite restaurant with your family.


## Quarterly

### Performance Appraisal of Creative Chaos
Every quarter, we want our associates to do a company performance appraisal. Essentially tell us how they think about their work and about Creative Chaos. This feedback provides us the necessary data to make Creative Chaos a better place.

We want everyone in the company to participate and not to ignore its value.
- It is completely anonymous. 
- We encourage you all to be honest in your assessment and feedback so we have real insights that we can act upon.
- The results are shared with all associates during the townhall with a plan on how to improve impacted areas.

### Quarterly Townhall
Every quarter we all get together for a couple of hours for a company-wide townhall. The session is conducted virtually on Zoom.
The objective of the townhall is
- To update all associates on business
- To share and discuss our Company Performance Appraisal
- To update and discuss next quarters objectives
- To give all associates an opportunity to ask any questions they may have


### Supervisors Feedback
Our culture of high performance is based on honesty and courage. We want to tell our supervisors what is working well and where we want them to improve. As an institutional practice, every quarter we provide honest feedback to our supervisors & managers. This is not a performance appraisal. This is feedback to help improve our colleagues who are responsible for us. Feedback forms go out in Dec, Mar, Jun & Sep.

### Supervisor Self-Assessment
Managing people is not easy and we all make mistakes every day. These mistakes end up costing us in team morale, quality, deliveries or over-all job satisfaction.

In order to minimize our mistakes and to course correct; our supervisors do a self-assessment of their leadership every quarter. This helps them become aware of the areas that their team is always thinking about and judging them by. Supervisors self-assess their work in Dec, Mar, Jun & Sep.

We share selected answers with the associates to help them understand the perspective of their leads and how they are thinking about improving themselves. 

### Intrapreneurship Showdown (Shark-tank style)
To encourage intrapreneurship at Creative Chaos, every quarter we host a shark tank style session where 3 associate pitch ideas. Ideas can either be around new business opportunities or how to improve something at Creative Chaos.

- Ideas are submitted in Jan,Apr,Jul,Oct
- Top 3 ideas are selected in Feb,May,Aug,Nov
- Showdown happens in the middle of Mar,Jun,Sep,Dec

Showdown is broadcasted on zoom.
- 10 minutes presentation for each idea.
- 10 minutes Q&A
- 3 judges evaluate and make a final decision.
- Winning idea gets a cash award of Rs.25,000 and perhaps the idea gets approved and funded for implementation.


## Yearly
### Company Annual Meetup
Every year we have an annual meetup in Karachi since this is where we have the most associates. 
The Annual meetup is usually in a banquet hall over hi-tea or dinner. We typically have this event in Jul / Aug.

The agenda is to go over company performance, highlight any significant achievements and honor any extra-ordinary performers.

For Associates not in Karachi: Unfortunately we cannot fly you down for this (maybe in the future); however, for now, you will participate via Zoom. We will also have you all go out for a nice dinner as a team.

## Random
### Lunch with UA & SH
Whenever UA or Shakir are in town, we get a group of 5 associates to have lunch with them.

- The 5 associates are randomly picked by HR using the random result generator.
- In order to save time commuting and going out somewhere... we order sandwiches / pizza / burger (something not messy) and do this in our conference room.

### #ama-ua
We have a "Ask me Anything" channel on Slack where associates can ask UA anything! Yes! Get those questions questions you have been thinking or talking about about with your colleagues during smoke and lunch breaks, answered. You know what they are. It doesn't matter... personal, professional, work, clients, business ... anything and everything goes here.

In addition; If you want to **"Tell UA Anything"** - send him a DM on Slack.

If you want to **"Talk to UA"** - setup a zoom call. You can find a slot [here](https://calendly.com/uaziz/quickchat)

If you want to **"Meet UA in person"** (and he's in town) - DM him and if he's not on a tight schedule, he will meet up.
