Over the years, we have found the following companies to have played a key role in how we think, how we act and how we aspire to be better.

## Mckinsey & Co.
As a Mckinsey technology partner we have seen them at work. We admire their work ethic, the quality of output and what they are willing to do for their clients. It is absolutely incredible. With over 2500 partners globally and thousands of associates; it does not matter who you work with, you will see that they all speak the same language and work with the same determination and drive. The speed at which they operate is also amazing. They truly are the four seasons of the consulting business. We strive to achieve that level of sophistication and attention to detail when it comes to service and delivery. We also read Mckinsey Insights that provide their latest thinking and helps us in understanding the needs of our enterprise clients better. Read at: https://www.mckinsey.com/insights 

## Netflix
The culture of Netflix has been talked about and discussed in the valley and beyond for years. It is not for everyone, but we totally relate with it. Our values and thinking is very similar to theirs. Our approach to running a high performance company is derived from how they run their organization. 

## Basecamp
Basecamp is primarily built by developers who work remotely (most working from home). Their ability to integrate, communicate and coordinate without friction is incredible. They prove that location, proximity and timezone does not matter if you have the right people, process and attitude towards getting things done. 

## Microsoft
Microsoft is not often talked about in the community (since they've been around for decades and even after trying hard - they come across as a boring, old company). However, we are inspired not by their products; but by how they train and grow people within the company. They've been in the software business for long and have done very well in creating a stable and structured career path for their employees. Its not a dog eat dog world out there. 

## Amazon
On the other hand, much has been talked about Amazon and how they care about their customers. However, what we are truly impressed with is their fearless attitude towards experimentation and failure - iterating and finding a solution that addresses a market pain point. Their speed of execution and iterating to find a solution is absolutely incredible. They are ruthless and relentless and they are never done. Every day is day zero for the company and they act like a startup. We love that - and use that to remind ourselves how we must never be satisfied and continuously improve and evolve.
