# Our Company Values
Everything we do is hard and confusing if we all believe in different things about what's important for our company. It is important that you understand what we stand for and what we believe in as a company. It is also important that you stand up and challenge when you see something inconsistent with our company values.

## Uphold promises
Our business is built on promises. We uphold them no-matter-what. Even if it means we have to lose money, allocate more resources or camp over night or on weekends to keep them.

## Embrace new technology
We constantly evolve our technology stack. We continuously judge ourselves on our ability to understand and apply latest principals in design and technology.  We are willing to give up old thinking, standards, tools and frameworks even if we have invested a lot of time and money developing them.

## Fight mediocrity
Mediocrity is a plague that we fight every day. We continuously raise the bar and drive our teams to deliver high quality products and solutions. We make sure that problems are addressed properly so they get fixed and stay fixed. We are willing to respectfully challenge decisions and disagree and will not compromise for the sake of social cohesion.

## Continuous improvement
We are never done learning and always seek to improve ourselves. We are curious about new methodologies, technologies and innovation and act to explore them.

## Earn Trust
We earn trust by treating each other with respect, by listening to all opposing viewpoints and by delivering upon promises made to our colleagues and our customers.

## Deliver Results
Speed and Agility matters in our business. We value calculated risks rather then deep extensive research and analysis paralysis. We understand that the success or failure of our customer's business objectives is highly dependent on our ability to deliver on time. We are relentless about delivering results and upholding our promises. 

## Focus on Quality
We hold ourselves to high quality standards. Many people may think these are unreasonable but that's what separates us from everyone else. We are self-critical and benchmark ourselves against the best.

## Hire & Develop the Best
Our ability to delivering consistently and maintaining high quality relies on hiring and developing the best. We recognize exceptional talent and give them opportunities within the organization to discover, grow and challenge themselves professionally.
