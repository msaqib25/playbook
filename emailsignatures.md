# Email Signatures

All our associates use our **Default** signature unless they are on the **Exception** list. If you are on the exception list, you will use the FULL Signature

## Default Signature
Here's the [Default signature](https://www.creativechaos.co/default-signature.html)

### How to use:
- Open the default signature in a browser.
- Ctrl-A, Ctrl-C and then Ctrl-V in the signature box of your mail client.

### Why is this signature so basic?
You will notice that the default signature seems very basic and missing a lot of information that you normally expect in a signature.

**1. There is no designation / title:**
- Our designations and titles at times creates unintended consequences. E.g Expectations from a "Principal Engineer" in our client's eyes, may be very different and they may set have expectations from you. 
- We are at times wearing different hats and juggling responsibilities. A title-less signature makes it easy to role-play without creating any confusion.

**2. There are no contact phone number or address**
- Putting in location geographies creates a bias which can hurt us more than help us. Most of our clients already know that our delivery teams are remote. Putting our address on the signature is a constant reminder and we are better off without it. 
- The client knows that the best way to reach you is by email. If they want to talk, we setup a Zoom meeting. 

**3. There are no social links**
- We are not active on social media at this point in time. This may change in the future. 

### Department Names
Putting a department in your signature is completely optional. If you do, use these department names to keep things standardized.

- Accounts
- Administration
- AppStudio
- Cloud Services
- Dedicated DevOps (Use this for Dedicated Teams)
- Digital Ops
- Digital Web
