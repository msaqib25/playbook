# Who Are Our Customers?

We work with 2 primary customer segments
- Startups
- Enterprises

**Startups:**
There are two types of startups that we focus on:
1. Seed startups that need help in developing a MVP (minimum viable product). (We call them internally as Profile 1)
2. VC funded startups that have demonstrated market fitness and need to help to scale & augment their internal development teams. (Profile 2)

**Enterprises:**
3. Mid-market / Fortune 1000 companies that need an innovation delivery partner to help build a platform or a service to address a marketplace opportunity. (Profile 3)

Our main customer base is in North America. However, as a global business we regularly see opportunities come from UK, Europe, Middle-East, South Africa and New Zealand.We have a pretty good web and digital services business in Pakistan.

## Why Do Our Customers Choose Us? ##
Believe it or not, our customers do not choose us because we are a fun, exciting and creative company (which we are). They choose us because they feel they can trust us. They need an innovation partner they can rely on - someone who can build, scale and support their initiatives. This is a major undertaking - there are huge cost and consequences for failure. 

1. Startup founders with the limited seed money they have raised from friends & family MUST have a MVP that they can go to market with. If they can't meet this milestone; its lights out for them.

2. VC funded startups that are seeing customer growth need a partner they can rely on for development bandwidth. If the partner is unable to deliver; it has serious consequences on their ability to keep growing.

3. Enterprises need to continuously innovate or fear being displaced by competition. This is a serious threat - Innovate or Die! Choosing the right partner that they can rely on for a successful outcome is a big decision.

**Its all about trust.**

Remember:
Our customers survival depends on our ability to deliver.Our survival depends on successful delivery.
**It is our fundamental belief that innovation can only be delivered through ruthless commitment, grit and resolve of the team.**

_“We help our customers transform their ideas into digital and technology solutions through our proven innovation delivery framework. Our process requires us to commit to the idea and take ownership and responsibility. Every member in the team makes successful delivery a personal challenge. We are ruthlessly committed to our promises and vow to do what ever it takes to uphold them.”_ - Umair Aziz – Chief Innovation & Technology Officer
