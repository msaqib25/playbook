## Who Are Our Customers?

We work with 2 primary customer segments
- Startups
- Enterprises

**Startups:**
There are two types of startups that we focus on:
1. Seed startups that need help in developing a MVP (minimum viable product). (We call them internally as Profile 1)
2. VC funded startups that have demonstrated market fitness and need to help to scale & augment their internal development teams. (Profile 2)

**Enterprises:**
3. Mid-market / Fortune 1000 companies that need an innovation delivery partner to help build a platform or a service to address a marketplace opportunity. (Profile 3)

Our main customer base is in North America. However, as a global business we regularly see opportunities come from UK, Europe, Middle-East, South Africa and New Zealand.We have a pretty good web and digital services business in Pakistan.

## Why Do Our Customers Choose Us? ##
Believe it or not, our customers do not choose us because we are a fun, exciting and creative company (which we are). They choose us because they feel they can trust us. They need an innovation partner they can rely on - someone who can build, scale and support their initiatives. This is a major undertaking - there are huge cost and consequences for failure. 

1. Startup founders with the limited seed money they have raised from friends & family MUST have a MVP that they can go to market with. If they can't meet this milestone; its lights out for them.

2. VC funded startups that are seeing customer growth need a partner they can rely on for development bandwidth. If the partner is unable to deliver; it has serious consequences on their ability to keep growing.

3. Enterprises need to continuously innovate or fear being displaced by competition. This is a serious threat - Innovate or Die! Choosing the right partner that they can rely on for a successful outcome is a big decision.

**Its all about trust.**

Remember:
Our customers survival depends on our ability to deliver.Our survival depends on successful delivery.
**It is our fundamental belief that innovation can only be delivered through ruthless commitment, grit and resolve of the team.**
