# Who Are Our Customers?

We work with 2 primary customer segments
- Startups
- Enterprises

**Startups:**
There are two types of startups that we focus on:
1. Seed startups that need help in developing a MVP (minimum viable product). (We call them internally as Profile 1)
2. VC funded startups that have demonstrated market fitness and need to help to scale & augment their internal development teams. (Profile 2)

**Enterprises:**
3. Mid-market / Fortune 1000 companies that need an innovation delivery partner to help build a platform or a service to address a marketplace opportunity. (Profile 3)

Our main customer base is in North America. However, as a global business we regularly see opportunities come from UK, Europe, Middle-East, South Africa and New Zealand.We have a pretty good web and digital services business in Pakistan.

## Why Do Our Customers Choose Us? ##
Believe it or not, our customers do not choose us because we are a fun, exciting and creative company (which we are). They choose us because they feel they can trust us. They need an innovation partner they can rely on - someone who can build, scale and support their initiatives. This is a major undertaking - there are huge cost and consequences for failure. 

1. Startup founders with the limited seed money they have raised from friends & family MUST have a MVP that they can go to market with. If they can't meet this milestone; its lights out for them.

2. VC funded startups that are seeing customer growth need a partner they can rely on for development bandwidth. If the partner is unable to deliver; it has serious consequences on their ability to keep growing.

3. Enterprises need to continuously innovate or fear being displaced by competition. This is a serious threat - Innovate or Die! Choosing the right partner that they can rely on for a successful outcome is a big decision.

**Its all about trust.**

Remember:
Our customers survival depends on our ability to deliver.Our survival depends on successful delivery.
**It is our fundamental belief that innovation can only be delivered through ruthless commitment, grit and resolve of the team.**

_“We help our customers transform their ideas into digital and technology solutions through our proven innovation delivery framework. Our process requires us to commit to the idea and take ownership and responsibility. Every member in the team makes successful delivery a personal challenge. We are ruthlessly committed to our promises and vow to do what ever it takes to uphold them.”_ - Umair Aziz – Chief Innovation & Technology Officer

# Our History #
Creative Chaos was founded in the summer of 2000 by Shakir Husain with 3 employees in a small room in his uncle's architecture practice in Karachi, Pakistan. The internet in 2000 was a dark and ugly place - it was all about iframes, <blink> tags, animated gifs and spaghetti perl-cgi. Shakir, 24 at that time, wanted to bring some sanity to this dark, mind-numbing web. Creative Chaos started out building websites for clients who cared about good design and aesthetics. We called it "New Media" back then. Believe it or not - our tag line back then was "Manage Your Digital Risk". There weren't too many companies back then that understood "New Media" or "Digital".  We developed a reputation and a niche clientele. Initially Creative Chaos only focused on websites, but soon found its way into application development as businesses realized that they needed much more then a website, they needed a "web-version" for their desktop apps. 

In the summer of 2004, Shakir was introduced to Umair by a mutual friend who worked at Creative Chaos. Umair had just recently moved from Boston, and was planning to start his own technology business. The purpose of the meeting for Umair was to get insights from Shakir on whether it was a good idea or not to get into this business. This casual conversation over a cup of tea at CC's Hali road office ended with Umair offering to buy into Shakir's business. And shortly after, Shakir and Umair became equal partners of Creative Chaos. It was an unusually quick transaction. From, first meeting to Umair becoming a partner - it took less than 2 weeks. The speed at which this transaction was completed set the tone for how the two would make decisions for the Company in the future. There's no analysis-paralysis at Creative Chaos.

The two divided and conquered. Shakir took over all things sales and business. Umair took over strategy and execution. Together they expanded the business into web, software, digital and innovation delivery. The company grew from 20 people to 300 over the next decade. 

Creative Chaos was incorporated in the US in 2007 and maintained an office in NewYork, since most of our clients were there.

In 2014 Shakir relocated to San Francisco with his family - the HQ was subsequently moved to SanFrancisco.

In 2016 Umair relocated to Boston with his family, and is in the process of building the North American team.

Over the last decade, Creative Chaos has been involved in many experiments and ventures. The way Umair calls it - "its our playground and we come to work to have fun". Fun means building things; fun means to fix things; fun means to try new ways to do things better; fun means angel investing in startups; partnering with ecommerce companies; starting a SKU product build unit; fun means to spin up a digital agency, create IP in location services, payments, telecom, fun means creating fintech and mass-transit solutions, and dabbling in b2b global technology supplier business. Fun is all about being curious and taking risks. 

Fun for us these days is helping startups and large enterprises bring their ideas to life. 18 years - is a long time. 

We survived, persisted and continue to grow because we are surrounded by associates who we can trust.... associates who were willing to go out of their way to grow the company.... associates who push themselves for excellence...associates who are selfless. We want to acknowledge two of them, without their commitment and contribution - we would not be here.
- Farhan Shaikh (employee # 2 - joined in 2000, still at CC) - responsible for design and aesthetics. He was the 'Creative' in Creative Chaos when we started and still continues to inspire us with his dedication and passion. 
- Imran S. Khan (early employee - joined in 2001, recently resigned because he is moving to Canada - but still an Advisor) - Joined us as an associate web designer and ended up leading the technology teams as Director of Technology and later CEO of Software Services. Imran has been our go to guy for all things technology and delivery and championed a lot of key successful engagements.
