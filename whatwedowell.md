# What Do We Do Well?

## Expertise:
- We have over 18 years of experience building products & platforms.

- We are technology agnostic; i.e we have a diverse set of technology capabilities. We have teams that code in Java, Ruby, .Net, Python, PHP, Javascript, Objective C, Swift. We work on a variety of databases (MySQL, Mongo, Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle), many different frameworks and are continuously evolving our devOps toolchain.

- We are also vertical agnostic; i.e we service clients across different industries - from oil & gas, banking, telecoms to ecommerce, manufacturing and retail.


## Credibility:
- From websites, platforms, mobile apps to big data, blockchain and IoT - we have successfully completed hundreds of successful projects for startups as well as future 500 customers.

- We have helped startups when they just had an idea and seen them all the way through to exits (both IPO and acquisitions). 


## Trust:
- We don't market ourselves. Our business is built on referral. You do good work - you get referred - you grow.

- Our average length of a dedicated team is about 3 years. Once a client starts working with us, they don't feel the need to stop. 


# What do we do distinctively that is relevant to our customers?
We have developed success frameworks and have created playbooks for how we do things to ensure that we can deliver quality -  consistently. Our frameworks and playbooks are always work in progress. We keep iterating them as we learn new and better way to solve problems efficiently.
