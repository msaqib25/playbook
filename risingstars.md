# Rising Stars

## Who are Rising Stars
The future of Creative Chaos is in the hands of young people. The people in senior management today where once upon a time young and fresh out of college. It is out ability to identify these stars when they are young that seperates us from others in the business. We firmly believe this and therefore regularly identify stars who we want to mentor and see if they have the mettle to be a future leader at Creative Chaos.

When we talk about leadership; we are talking about someone who 
1) Understands, believes and acts in accordance with our [Company Values](ourcompanyvalues.md)
2) Embodies the [values that we care about](whatwevalueinassociates.md) in our associates.

## What is this program
The Rising Stars program is strongly biased towards young and new associates. In order to be a rising star **you should have worked at Creative Chaos for < 3 years.** 

- Every Quarter all leads / supervisors nominate potential stars from their team. 
- In order to nominate someone, you need to email HR a recommendation note on why this person is a good candidate to be a rising star. 
- The note should have concrete examples around the traits listed above.
- HR & leadership will shortlist 3 associates from these nominations. Short-listing will be done based on the quality of the recommendation. So it is important that the supervisor spends time to make a compelling case.
- Nominated  associates will be interviewed by leadership. 
- Based on the interviews, 1 associate will be selected as a rising star each quarter.

Rising stars are:
- Celebrated across the company as associates who can possibly be the future pillars of the firm.
- They receive 1-1 mentoring from leadership. They get a unique understanding into different aspects of the business.
- They work closely with leadership on strategy and key business decisions.
- They form a relationship with senior management and leadership that helps them develop a growth plan within Creative Chaos.
- They are rigourously tested in multiple disciplines.

If you think you have the DNA to be a future leader and have been demonstrating good judgement and contributing at extra-ordinary levels; discuss a nomination to be a rising start with your supervisor and work on your recommendation.
